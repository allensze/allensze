I am a game producer, UI designer and programmer, and Computer Science student at DigiPen Institute of Technology who loves working where technology and creativity overlap.

Bringing teams together to build responsive, player focused experiences is my passion.

I have led cross disciplinary teams on projects like Bring Da Beat Back, a 3D rhythm based beat ‘em up in Unreal Engine, balancing production work with hands on UI implementation. Before that, I helped coordinate development on Tileverse and RE:Pent in custom C/C++ engines, and built my own Unity prototype, Frogology, to explore quest design and research style UI. Across all of these projects, I focus on clear communication, realistic scope, and creating satisfying, readable gameplay for players.

I am grateful for every opportunity I have had to learn from my teams and projects so far, and I am always eager to keep growing, pick up new skills, and take on fresh challenges in game development.
